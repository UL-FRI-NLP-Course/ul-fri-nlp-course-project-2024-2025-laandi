## Smart Academic Research Assistant: Conversational Agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This repository contains our research project for the Natural Language Processing course at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana (2024/2025).

## Project Overview

We present a specialized conversational agent designed to enhance academic research by combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with dynamic web scraping. The system aims to provide accurate, citation-backed responses while addressing common limitations of traditional language models such as outdated information and hallucinations.

### Research Goals

- Develop a more focused and precise academic research assistant
- Integrate multiple academic paper sources through API interfaces and web scraping
- Implement efficient vector similarity search using FAISS
- Evaluate the effectiveness of combining RAG with real-time web data
